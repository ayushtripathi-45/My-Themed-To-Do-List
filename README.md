## 🛠️ Tech Stack :

* **HTML5** – Structure of the to‑do application.
* **CSS3** – Custom themes, hover effects, shadows, animations.
* **JavaScript** – Theme switching, task addition logic, UI interactivity.
* **Google Fonts / Web Fonts** – For improved text styling.
* **Responsive Design Techniques** – Flexbox, fluid card layout.

---

## 🚀 Features :

* Theme switcher (Default / 🌞 / 🌙). Themes change background, card color, and shadow/glow accents.

* Stylish, rounded input with a floating placeholder and a pill-shaped Add button that displays a glow on hover.

* Buttons that animate and show subtle inner/outer glows on hover and focus for accessibility.

* Smooth hover transitions on list items: elevation, color tint, and small transform.

* Keyboard accessible: add tasks using `Enter`; focus outlines preserved for keyboard navigation

---

## ⚙️ Usage :

* Use the theme controls at the top of the card to switch between themes.
* Click the input to type a new task, then press **Add** or hit **Enter** to add the task.
* Hover over buttons and the input to see the glow and shadow effects.
* Tasks can be expanded later to include edit/delete functionality (not included in this minimalist component but easy to extend).

---

## 🎨 Themes :

* **Default**: balanced, slightly saturated blue card with teal glow accents.
* **Day / Light**: light card, faint outer shadow, subtle aqua focus on buttons.
* **Night / Dark**: deep navy/violet background, strong soft neon glow around the add button and theme controls.
